# LeetCode
LeetCode solutions, including variation attempts, and optimized solutions found elsewhere. 

## Categories
- `Originals` are the solutions I personally came up with from scratch, without any outside help or influence.
- `After Research` are solutions that are based on research and viewing other solutions, but implemented by me.
- `Copied` is exactly what it sounds like. Copy & paste solutions from elsewhere. These are included for performance testing and as a reference point, but are in no way my work.

## Programming Lanugages

- Typescript is my daily language and often what I use for the first solution.
- Rust is a highly superior language for most projects/applications, prior to this project I have never written Rust. This project serves as me learning Rust's syntax and idiosyncrasies. 

## LeetCode Performance Metrics

Runtime metrics are difficult, because even on the same hardware, the time to process a given set of data can vary. It seems that LeetCode has not properly accounted for this, so all performance metrics should be considered rough only. If a given challenge is within 10ms total then there's essentially no value in the runtime. On add-two-numbers I ran 3 solutions, each with an improvement. I got the worst to run in 2ms and the best to be as slow as 6ms. This kind of granular analysis requires a different approach outside of LeetCode's platform (maybe a project idea!)
