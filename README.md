# LeetCode
LeetCode solutions, including variation attempts, and optimized solutions found elsewhere. 

- `Originals` are the solutions I personally came up with from scratch, without any outside help or influence.
- `After Research` are solutions that are based on research and viewing other solutions, but implemented by me.
- `Copied` is exactly what it sounds like. Copy & paste solutions from elsewhere. These are included for performance testing and as a reference point, but are in no way my work.
